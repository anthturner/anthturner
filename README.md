# Hello! 👋

- 💖 I'm a big fan of **security by design**. I love to write software (and plugins for other software!) to try to help people become more secure with as little effort as possible. Everything I build, I consider how to integrate security in a way which isn't too obtrusive to really use.

- 🐱‍💻 My **development languages** of choice are C#, Python, Javascript/Typescript, and some shell scripts. When it comes to **UX** languages, I love the Bootstrap methodology of HTML/CSS development and use it everywhere I can.

- 👷‍♂️ I'm currently **working on** a major OSS project for enabling the safe execution of high-privilege operations in cloud platforms. That can be found at https://www.secopssteward.com (... code [here](https://github.com/secopssteward/))
