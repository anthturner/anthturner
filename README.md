# Hello! 👋

- 💖 I'm a big fan of security by design. I love to write software (and plugins for other software!) to try to help people become more secure with as little effort as possible. Everything I build, I consider how to integrate security in a way which isn't too obtrusive to really use.

- 🐱‍💻 My **development languages** of choice are C#, Python, Javascript/Typescript, and some shell scripts. When it comes to **UX** languages, I love the Bootstrap methodology of HTML/CSS development and use it everywhere I can.
